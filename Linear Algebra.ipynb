    "##### What is the difference between a point and a vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "Points and vectors are not the same thing. Given two points in 3D space, we can make a vector from the first point to the second. And, given a vector and a point, we can start at the point and \"follow\" the vector to get another point.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nice fact, however: the points in 3D space (or $\\mathbb{R^n}$\n",
    ", more generally) are in a very nice correspondence with the vectors that start at the point $(0,0,0)$\n",
    ". Essentially, the idea is that we can represent the vector with its ending point, and no information is lost. This is sometimes called putting the vector in \"standard position\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For a course like vector calculus, it is important to keep a good distinction between points and vectors. Points correspond to vectors that start at the origin, but we may need vectors that start at other points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given three points A, B, and C \n",
    " in 3D space, we may want to find the equation of the plane that spans them, If we just knew the normal vector n⃗ \n",
    " of the plane, we could write the equation directly as $\\vec{n}$ . (x,y,z)=$\\vec{n}$.A\n",
    ". So we need to find that normal n⃗ \n",
    ". To do that, we compute the cross product of the vectors $\\vec{AB}$\n",
    " and $\\vec{AC}$\n",
    ". If we computed the cross product of A\n",
    " and C\n",
    " instead (pretending they are vectors in standard position), we could not get the right normal vector.\n",

    ", B=(0,1,0)\n",

    "\n",
    "To summarize, a location is where (or when) you are, and a displacement is how to get from one location to another. Displacements have both magnitude (how far to go) and a direction (which in time, a one-dimensional space, is simply positive or negative). In space, locations are points and displacements are vectors. In time, locations are (points in) time, a.k.a. instants and displacements are durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDIT 1: In response to some of the comments, I should point out that 4:00 p.m. is NOT a displacement, but \"+4 hours\" and \"-7 hours\" are. Sure you can get to 4:00 p.m. (an instant) by adding the displacement \"+16 hours\" to the instant midnight. You can also get to 4:00 p.m. by adding the diplacement \"-3 hours\" to 7:00 p.m. The source of the confusion between locations and displacements is that people mentally work in coordinate systems relative to some origin (whether (0,0)\n",
    " or \"midnight\" or similar) and both of these concepts are represented as coordinates. I guess that was the point of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDIT 2: I added some text to make clear that durations actually have direction; I had written both -2.5 hours and +3 hours earlier, but some might have missed that the negative encapsulated a direction, and felt that a duration is \"only a scalar\" when in fact the adding of a +\n",
